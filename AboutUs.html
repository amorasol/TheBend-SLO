<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3>What:</h3><p>A music venue hosting local house show bands from around SLO</p> <h3>Where:</h3><p>Walking distance from Cal Poly campus neighboorhoods on Foothill Blvd.</p> <h3>When:</h3><p>Opening day in Fall 2022!<h3>Why:</h3><p>There are many well-established music venues in SLO. However, these venues are a 10-15-minute drive from the neighborhoods in which most students live, alcohol serving and thus 21+, or only host large touring acts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the majority of music events in SLO are attended by Cal Poly students. There are also many student bands that play house shows throughout SLO. Local authorities are forced to shut these shows down for noise ordinance. </p><h2>Therefore,we are creating THE BEND, a music venue walking distance from Cal Poly neighboorhoods, made to host local house show bands, and complying with local noise ordidnances. </h2><h2>Join us on our journey in supporting SLO's music scene.</h2><!--/p>Yet music venues in SLO lack proximity to the majority student crowds they host</h2> <h2>A venue for students, a platform for local bands </h2>
